# 🌾 Rice Leaf Disease Prediction using CNN

A deep learning project developed using **TensorFlow** and **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)** to automatically classify rice leaf diseases from leaf images.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

Rice is one of the world's major food crops, and diseases affecting rice leaves can significantly reduce crop yield and quality. This project develops a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) that classifies rice leaf images into three disease categories.

The project was implemented as part of the given problem statement:

> **Rice Leaf Disease Prediction using Machine Learning**

The model was first trained as a **Baseline CNN** and later improved using **Data Augmentation** to increase its ability to generalize on unseen data.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Develop a CNN model for rice leaf disease classification.
- Classify rice leaf images into three disease categories.
- Improve model performance using data augmentation.
- Evaluate the model using standard classification metrics.

## 🗂 Dataset

Dataset consists of **120 RGB images** divided into three classes.

| Class | Images |
|--------|--------|
| Bacterial Leaf Blight | 40 |
| Brown Spot | 40 |
| Leaf Smut | 40 |

Dataset Split:

- Training : 80% (96 images)
- Validation : 10% (12 images)
- Testing : 10% (12 images)

Images are resized to:

```
224 × 224 × 3
```
